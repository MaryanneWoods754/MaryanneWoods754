## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to this repository â€” a growing collection of projects and experiments focused on time series forecasting. As a junior data scientist with a strong interest in temporal data, this space serves as both a portfolio and a sandbox for learning, testing, and sharing insights gained through hands-on exploration.

My work here revolves around understanding and modeling patterns in time-dependent data. From classic statistical methods like ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing to more modern machine learning approaches such as Prophet, XGBoost, and deep learning models like LSTM, this repository documents various strategies and techniques used in real-world forecasting tasks.

Each project is built with an emphasis on reproducibility, clean code, and clear documentation. Notebooks are structured to walk through the full data science workflow: data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization. Whether it's financial data, energy consumption, or web traffic trends, the goal is always to create interpretable, accurate models that provide actionable insights.

Beyond model performance, thereâ€™s a strong interest in tools that support efficient forecasting pipelines â€” things like automated model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and handling missing or irregular data. These challenges are part of what makes time series analysis both complex and rewarding.

This repository is open to feedback and collaboration. Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast, a mentor, or someone exploring time series for the first time, I hope you find value in what's shared here. Contributions, questions, and suggestions are always welcome.

Thanks for visiting â€” letâ€™s keep learning and building.
